# My BookStack Hacks

These are my little hacks for Bookstack. 
As I use most of these myself and update [Bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/) via Docker on a regular basis, these should work on the latest versions.  
But like always no guarantee. 

**CSV - Visualizer**  
Using Papa parse + Grid.JS to display CSV data from linked files.
